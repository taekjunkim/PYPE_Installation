Simple instructions for installing pype on a new machine
with a started redhat (typically redhat-8 in the gallant
lab, with ALL packages installed) machine. Just follow
the steps in order..

1. make a copy of this entire source tree...work there!
2. make sure dacq card is installed
3. build and install comedi device drivers and comedilib:
     (NOTE: there's something wrong with the doc/html target in the
     comedilib-0.7.21 release such that the html generation results
     in errors that abort the build and install. I edited Makefile.in
     to skip building the doc files for now, so there should be no
     errors during this process and the *.h files SHOULD get installed
     correctly -- JAM 06-jan-2004)

	cd External
	cd comedi-0.7.66
	make
        >>> this now goes through the config process, make sure
        >>> you say 'M' for the DAS boards, you can/should say 'N' for
        >>> everything else
        ;XXX WARNING: don't use comedi-0.7.67, something's wrong..
	;XXX cd comedi-0.7.67
	;XXX ./configure
	make
	sudo make install
	sudo make dev
	make distclean
	cd ../comedilib-0.7.21
	./configure --prefix=/usr
	# NOTE: NEXT TWO COMMANDS MIGHT GENERATE ERRORS ON DOCS, OK TO IGNORE!!
	make
	sudo make install
	# sudo cp include/*.h /usr/include
	make distclean
	sudo depmod -a
	cd ../..
	sudo cp load_cb_pcidas /usr/sbin
	sudo sh -c 'echo "/usr/sbin/load_cb_pcidas" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local'
	sudo ./load_cb_pcidas

4. install missing bits pype will need (Numeric, biggles/libplot,
   pygame, current SDL snapshot, PIL):
	   % cd External
	   % ./INSTALL
	   ...wait..
	   % ./CLEAN
5. go back to pype2 toplevel dir (cd ..) and do a complete install:
	   % sudo ./build install wrapper clean

6. check to make sure pype works -- don't forget you need a
   ~/.pyperc/Config.<hostname> for the new machine...
