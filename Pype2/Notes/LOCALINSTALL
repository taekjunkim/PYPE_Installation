When you do:

 sudo ./build install wrapper clobber

pype will get installed into PYPEDIR, which is usually a shared
installation directory.

If you want to install a local copy on your machine, do this:

 env PYPEDIR=/usr/local/pype2 sudo ./build install wrapper clobber 

This will install into /usr/local -- make sure /usr/local/pype2/bin
is on your path and PYPEDIR is set to /usr/local/pype2 and you should
be good to go (running standalone or off-network).
