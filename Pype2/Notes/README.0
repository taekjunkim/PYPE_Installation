This is "pype2".  A newer, cleaner, gentler version of pype.
This version attempts to simplify and consolidate the codebase
to make it easier to use, read and understand.  Basically, I've
moved as much C/swig as possible into native python, keeping
only C/swig stuff from near-RT parts (namely data acquisition).

**********************  IMPORTANT  **************************
   The SUPPORTED platform for running pype is now officially
 redhat 7.2, with everything installed (most important is that
   python2.1 be installed).  Things should still run fine on
 other versions, but the install process should be completely
      automatically on a fully installed redhat 7.2 box.
********************************** **************************

In addition:
  1. The src directory has been reorganized to simplify things.
     Almost all of the code modules live in src/pype, including
     sprite.py (the pygame/sdl/framebuffer interface).  src/dacq2
     contains C/swig code needed for data acquisition and src/wrapper
     contains the suid-root bootloader needed to access DGA mode
     and raw i/o ports.  The bootloading system has been dramatically
     simplified and is now essentially 100% python, save for the root
     wrapper program.  src/sh/pype is just a shell script that
     runs: "exec pypeboot pyperun ..."; similarly, src/sh/pypenv runs
     the command "exec pypeboot pyperun -s ...", which tells pype to
     enter scripting mode..

  2. The build process should now be pretty much painless.  You should
     be able to pretty much do a "make build" and then a "make install"
     to get things up and running.  This includes all the rpm's and
     external packages pype needs needs (biggles, Numeric etc). Note
     that a custom version of SDL will also be installed!

     At least part of this will need to be done as root.  You can
     set the installation target by setting the PYPEDIR environment
     before you start compiling, eg:
	env PYPEDIR=`pwd` make build
	env PYPEDIR=`pwd` make install
     Will build and install in the current directory, then you just
     need to have `pwd`/bin on your path and you're ready to go.
