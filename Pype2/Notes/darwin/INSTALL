To build on Mac OS X:

Dependencies:
 Install Fink (http://fink.sourceforge.net)
 fink install pygame-py24 biggles-py24 opengl-py24 grace

You can't compile the DACQ drivers on OS X.  Instead:
 ./build install-nodacq wrapper clean

In OpenGL mode, everything works fine.

In pygame mode, you may have problems with surface unlocking, 
in which case apply something like the patch in this directory to 
/usr/local/pype2/lib/sprite.py.
