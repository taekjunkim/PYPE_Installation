# PYPE_Installation
1. This repository includes original PYPE code forked from 
    - https://github.com/mazerj/pype2  
    - https://github.com/mazerj/pype3
2. This repository incluldes revised PYPE code
    - pype2_32bit
        - revised to work with eth32 box
    - pype2_64bit with PWM
        - revised to work with eth32 box & pulse width modulation control in 64bit machine
    - pype_Python3
        - The previous versions were created based on Python2, which is not officially supported anymore, so it is very difficult to add newly developed packages
        - In this version, I made a few major changes to have pype work on Python 3
            - Numpy replaces Numeric
            - Grammatical changes
        - Here, I attached working task files as well, but task files (working in older version, not included here) would require some debugging processes.
